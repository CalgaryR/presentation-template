# Motivation

The Xaringan package was designed by Yihui Xie, who is a fantastic software Engineer at RStudio. Xaringan is based on [reveal.js](https://github.com/gnab/remark), with additional support featured for Rmarkdown. When starting with Xaringan I found Yihui's tutorial overly comprehensive with the inclusion of Chinese language functionality and Naruto references, so this is my attempt at a simplified version for reference when trying to quickly develop a presentation.If you want to read the more comprehensive guide it is available here: https://github.com/yihui/xaringan
